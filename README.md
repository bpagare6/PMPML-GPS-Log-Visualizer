# PMPML-GPS-Log-Visualizer
COEP Hackathon Project on Pune Open Data of PMPML GPS Logs of 8 days 19/01/2019-27/01/2019

Problem Statement: To Visualize the GPS Logs of PMPML and make animation of it.

Approach:
1. First Extract the given dataset from tar.gz file
2. Make the clear Data Set by removing the irrelevent part
3. Filter the Data Set with respect to One PMPML route-id
4. Then Sorted the New Data Set as per Time Frame
5. Plotted each point on the Google Map
6. Then Created the Animation from it

To get started first install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Then run jupyter notebook,
`jupyter-notebook`

And then complete the setup by running,
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run this on Your System first [Download the Dataset Here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-kiz85TvxyHuZsSCDjGtP0IMH56v-uxN&export=download)

This idea can be further be taken to finding out the traffic distribution over the city and understanding vehicle movements in city area.
